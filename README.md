# CloudSim
A web-based platform that simulates core cloud infrastructure concepts like compute instances, containers, networking, and monitoring without using real cloud costs. Users can “spin up” virtual VMs, deploy sample apps, visualize network traffic, and monitor resource usage through custom backend simulation.
